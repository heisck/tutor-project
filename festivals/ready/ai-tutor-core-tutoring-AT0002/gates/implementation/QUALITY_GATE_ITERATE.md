# Gate: Review Results and Iterate

Address all findings from testing and code review. Iterate until the sequence meets quality standards.

## Findings to Address

### From Testing

- [ ] (list findings from testing gate)

### From Code Review

- [ ] (list findings from review gate)

## Iteration

For each finding:

1. Fix the issue
2. Re-run affected tests
3. Re-run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and relevant sequence tests
4. Re-check ownership, security, and prompt-grounding expectations if the fix touches those areas

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All critical findings fixed
- [ ] All tests pass after changes
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Typechecking passes
- [ ] Code review findings addressed
- [ ] Regression checks and any required end-to-end verifications were re-run
- [ ] Ready to commit
