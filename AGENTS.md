## AI Instructions

<!-- Add specific instructions for AI agents -->

Planning-layer rule of thumb: use `camp intent` for fast capture and small actionable work, `workflow/design/` for architecture or exploratory thinking, and festivals for structured multi-step execution. Intent state is stored under `.campaign/intents/`. Canonical guide: https://fest.build/guides/intent-design-festival/
