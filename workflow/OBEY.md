# Workflow

Lightweight planning and coordination spaces that complement festivals.

## Purpose

`workflow/` holds the less-structured planning surfaces that humans and agents use
constantly while solving hard problems.

These directories are not a replacement for `festivals/`. They sit alongside
festivals and often become input material for a festival ingest or planning phase.

## Camp Contract

- A pre-scaffolded directory with an `OBEY.md` file is part of camp's expected
  campaign structure.
- If a pre-scaffolded directory does not have an `OBEY.md`, it is usually
  optional in normal campaign use.

## Planning Surfaces

- `camp intent` is the quick-capture interface for ideas, rough specs, and
  future work. Camp stores that system-owned state under `.campaign/intents/`.
- `workflow/explore/` is for research, topic exploration, prototypes, and
  investigation when implementation is still uncertain.
- `workflow/design/` is for implementation-bound design work you actually expect
  to build.
- `festivals/` is for hierarchical plans with explicit phases, sequences, and
  tasks.

`workflow/code_reviews/` and `workflow/pipelines/` support adjacent operational
work, but the main planning split is between intent capture, explore, design,
and festivals.

## Structure

```
workflow/
├── code_reviews/       # Review artifacts and quality notes
├── design/             # Implementation-bound design work
├── explore/            # Research, spikes, and prototypes
└── pipelines/          # CI/CD and automation workflow material
```

Intent state is intentionally not scaffolded under `workflow/`. Use
`camp intent` and `cgo i` for the hidden `.campaign/intents/` tree.

## Navigation

```bash
cgo w                   # Jump to workflow/
cgo cr                  # Jump to code_reviews/
cgo de                  # Jump to design/
cgo ex                  # Jump to explore/
cgo pi                  # Jump to pipelines/
cgo i                   # Jump to .campaign/intents/ (camp-managed state)
```
