# Pipelines

CI/CD pipeline definitions and automation scripts.

## What Goes Here

- GitHub Actions workflows
- GitLab CI configurations
- Docker build files
- Deployment scripts
- Automation utilities

## Structure

```
pipelines/
├── github/            # GitHub Actions workflows
├── docker/            # Dockerfiles and compose
├── scripts/           # Automation scripts
├── terraform/         # Infrastructure as code
└── dungeon/           # Archived pipelines
    ├── completed/
    ├── archived/
    └── someday/
```

## Guidelines

- Keep pipelines versioned with the code
- Document required secrets and environment variables
- Test pipelines in isolated environments
- Use `camp dungeon crawl` to triage retired pipelines into dungeon
