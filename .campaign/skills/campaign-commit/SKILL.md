# Campaign Commit Decision

Read shared contracts first: `../references/camp-command-contracts.md` and `../references/fest-command-contracts.md`.

## Decision

- Project submodule change: `camp p commit -m "msg"`
- Festival task execution: `fest commit -m "msg"`
- Campaign root files: `git commit -m "msg"`
- Intentional root pointer sync: `camp refs-sync [submodule...]`

## Rules

- Keep submodule commits and root pointer sync as separate, explicit actions.
- Avoid raw `git commit` in submodules when campaign tooling is available.
- Do not add agent co-author trailers unless explicitly requested.
- Do not bypass hooks with `--no-verify` without clear justification.
