# Festival Planning

Read shared contracts first: `../references/fest-command-contracts.md`.

## Start Here

```bash
fest understand methodology
fest understand structure
fest understand tasks
fest understand rules
fest types festival
```

Topic index: `references/understand-topics.md`.

`fest types` is low-frequency but high-value: use it at festival setup time or whenever type choice is unclear.

## Naming Rules (Automation-Critical)

- Phase dir: `NNN_UPPER_CASE/` (example `001_IMPLEMENT/`)
- Sequence dir: `NN_lower_snake_case/` (example `01_auth_module/`)
- Task file: `NN_lower_snake_case.md` (example `01_create_handler.md`)

Every sequence should include `SEQUENCE_GOAL.md`.

## Festival Types (Choose Before Scaffolding)

Use `fest types festival` / `fest types festival show <type>` as source of truth for your workspace.

- `standard`: balanced default, use when work needs ingest + planning before implementation.
- `implementation`: execution-only, use when specs/plan already exist and coding can start directly.
- `research`: investigation-heavy, use when decisions depend on comparative analysis and synthesis.
- `ritual`: recurring/custom pattern, use for repeatable non-standard workflows.

Create with explicit type:

```bash
fest create festival --type standard --name <name>
fest create festival --type implementation --name <name>
fest create festival --type research --name <name>
fest create festival --type ritual --name <name> --dest ritual
```

## Phase Types (Choose by Work Shape)

- `planning`: workflow phase for architecture/decision-making (`WORKFLOW.md`, no numbered sequences).
- `research`: workflow phase for investigation and findings (`WORKFLOW.md`, sources/findings).
- `ingest`: workflow phase for normalizing incoming context/specs (`WORKFLOW.md`, input/output specs).
- `implementation`: sequence-driven coding phase (numbered sequences/tasks, quality gates).
- `review`: freeform acceptance/signoff phase (goal-driven, not task-heavy).
- `non_coding_action`: freeform operational actions (coordination, rollout, non-code tasks).

Create with explicit phase type:

```bash
fest create phase --name "001_IMPLEMENT" --type implementation
fest create phase --name "002_RESEARCH" --type research
```

## Create / Promote

```bash
fest create festival
fest create phase
fest create sequence
fest create task

fest promote
fest validate
```

## Link + FGO Navigation (Required for Project-Context Execution)

```bash
# In festival directory
fest link [path]
fest link --show
fest links
fest unlink

# Shell helper after `eval "$(fest shell-init zsh)"`
fgo
fgo project
fgo fest
```

If the working project directory changes (new worktree, moved repo, different checkout), rerun `fest link` so `fgo`, `fest next`, and `fest commit` resolve correctly from the project path.

## Type and Scaffolding

```bash
fest types list
fest types show <type-name>
```

Advanced generation path (not the default planning entrypoint):

```bash
fest scaffold from-plan --plan STRUCTURE.md --name my-festival
```

## Common Mistakes

- Using `fest link --project ...` (invalid).
- Assuming an old link still works after changing project directory location.
- Picking `implementation` type when requirements are still unclear (should be `standard` or `research` first).
- Using workflow phase types when you need numbered implementation task execution.
- Using noncompliant naming patterns (`P1-...`, `S1-...`, `T1-...`).
- Treating `fest scaffold` base command as if it performs generation by itself.
